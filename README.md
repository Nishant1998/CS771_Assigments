# Machine Learning Model Implementation (CS771_Assigments)

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models undertaken during the CS771 Introduction to Machine Learning course (Aug'21 - Nov'21) under the guidance of Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava.


## Project Overview

- Developed **K-NN** Regression and **Decision Tree** Classification models from scratch.
- Constructed the **Perceptron Algorithm** and implemented diverse variations of Gradient Descent algorithms.
- Employed Gaussian Kernel for **K-means** implementation.
- Executed **Expectation-Maximization** on synthetic data.
- Utilized **MCMC sampling** for approximating Bayesian Posteriors.
## Dataset

Dataset used are present inside the respective folder in cvs formate.

## How to Run
For each algorithm code is in jupyter notebook inside respective folders.
